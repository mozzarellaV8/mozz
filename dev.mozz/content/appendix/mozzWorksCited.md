	"Data, sounds, and images are now 
	routinely transitioning beyond screens 
	into a different state of matter. 
	They surpass the boundaries of 
	data channels and manifest materially. 
	They incarnate as riots or products, 
	as lens flares, high-rises, or pixelated tanks...

	...Artificial islands mimic 
	 genetically manipulated plants.
	 Dental offices parade 
	 as car commercial film sets. 
	 Cheekbones are airbrushed 
	 just as whole cities pretend 
	 to be YouTube CAD tutorials. 
	 Artworks are e-mailed 
	 to pop up in bank lobbies 
	 designed on fighter jet software...

	...A nail paint clip turns into an Instagram riot.
	An upload comes down as shitstorm."

	"We're witnessing the beggining of a massive, 
	culturally saturated feedback loop 
	where our behavior changes the product 
	and the product changes our behavior.
	Technology makes this possible: 
	infrastructure for large-scale data processing, 
	increased memory and bandwidth, 
	as well as a cultural acceptance of technology 
	in the fabric of our lives."

[In Conversation with Julian Assange, Part I](http://www.e-flux.com/journal/in-conversation-with-julian-assange-part-i/) Hans Ulrich-Obrist, e-flux, 2011

	“And there’s another type of information 
	in our intellectual record...
	This second type of information no longer has an economy behind it. 
	It has already found its way into the historical record through 
	a state of affairs which no longer exists. 
	So it’s just sitting there. It can be slowly rotting away, 
	slowly vanishing. Books go out of print, 
	and the number of copies available decreases. 
	But it is a slow process, 
	because no one is actively trying to destroy 
	this type of information.”

[Tim O' Reilly on Piracy, Tinkering, and the Future of the Book](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jonbruner/2011/03/25/tim-oreilly-on-piracy-tinkering-and-the-future-of-the-book/#595a33447dc6) Jon Bruner, Forbes Magazine, 2011

On all your titles you’ve dropped digital rights management (DRM), 
which limits file sharing and copying. Aren’t you worried about piracy?

	"No. And so what? Let’s say my goal is to sell 10,000 copies of something. 
	And let’s say that if by putting DRM in it I sell 10,000 copies and I make my money, 
	and if by having no DRM 100,000 copies go into circulation and I still sell 10,000 copies. 
	Which of those is the better outcome? I think having 100,000 in circulation 
	and selling 10,000 is way better than having just the 10,000 that are paid for and nobody else benefits.

	People who don’t pay you generally wouldn’t have paid you anyway. 
	We’re delighted when people who can’t afford our books don’t pay us for them, 
	if they go out and do something useful with that information."
