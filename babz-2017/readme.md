# Work in Progress

![branding-sketch-2-3](pictures/mozz-tex-V0-23.jpg)

Above is a sketch in progress. _What if companies open-sourced the full process of design and production?_ I suppose that would violate a non-disclosure agreement, or maybe worse hurt the brand in some way. Regardless,

Here's a table of work in progress for [BABZ 2017](http://blondeartbooks.com), arranged alphabetically by author or organization. Some projects will happen; others may not. Things may end up on the table that aren't listed here. 

As George Carlin once said, **_"Only time will tell."_**
