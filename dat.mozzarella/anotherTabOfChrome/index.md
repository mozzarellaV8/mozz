Language - be it spoken, written, vis<font color="white">ual, natural, native, for</font>mal, foreign, <font color = "white">forbidden, forgotten, fun</font>ctional, fa<font color = "white">ncy, emoti</font>onal, pri<font color = "white">vate, pu</font>blic, inv<font color = "white">en</font>ted, or unspoken - is the theme. _Log<font color = "white">o</font>s_.

- ATC follows the 'gr<font color = "white">oup show in a publicat</font>ion' model.
- annual/bi-annual TBD
- Publications are nice democratic forms that circualate and have presence. 
- Each contribu <font color = "white"> tor will be allotted between 1-12 pages for their piece/project/submission
- Could be more or less than that too de</font>pending on the pro<font color="white">ject - but anything needing more than 24 or 32 pages sounds like something that can become it's own book. 
- open to ideas that can't be put on a page, so we can figure out how to tr</font>anslate them.

Language has held a unique place in human learning. <font color="white">It has functioned as a means of storing and transporting information, a vehicle for exhanging ideas, and a way for the human mind to conceptualize. _Logos_, the Greek for language, also carries collateral meaning of thought and reason in the English word derived from it, logic. The implications are quite obvious; language is seen as a means for a higher form of thikning than the visual and tactile modes. _But the assumption is subject to some question and investigation..._

Languages are logical wholes. But no such simplicity can be ascribed to visual intelligence, and those of use who labored to make it analagous to language have been engaged in an exercise in futility.</font>

<font color="white">..he asked 'What would be a more perfect _Logos_?' And he imagined a form of communication where the ears would not be the primary receptors, but the eyes would be. A language where meaning was not constructed through a dictionary of spoken words, but where </font>three-dimensional objects were actually generated with a kind of hyperlanguage so <font color = "white">that there was perfect understanding between people. </font>

###### _What does the ti<font color = "white">t</font>le ref<font color = "white">e</font>r to?_

[m<font color = "white">i</font>ld spo<font color = "white">iler</font>]
William Gibson wrote a sh<font color = "white">ort story called **_Burning Chrome_** back in 1982. Always loved that title. **Chrome** in this story is a shadowy criminal who handles finances for various organized crime groups. The story itself is told from the perspective of two freelance hackers who infiltrate **Chrome's** system and empty his bank accounts...to impress a girl, who ends up taking other money from Chrome to get </font>cybernetic eye implan<font color = "white">ts and move to Hollywood. She had her own life to live. 

**Chrome** is also Google's web browser product. Of course one of **Chrome's** features is the **tab** graphical user interface, allowing multiple panels or documents to be open simultaneously in one window. 

But when I thought of the word **'Tab'**, I ha</font>d lysergic acid in m<font color = "white">ind </font>m<font color = "white">ore than Google. **'Another'** came out of imagining a sequel to Gibson's story. **'of'** is a preposition that can express a relationship between parts and a whole. And if you've gotten this far, I won't say anything more about **'C</font>hrome<font color = "white">'**. </font>

###### _Why me?_

<font color="white">I am a fan of your work and interested in </font>what you think about and make.</font>

###### _When is the deadline?_

September 27th, 2016. My apologies if this is too little time. My apologies if this is too much time. 

###### _What should I make?_
<font color="white">
It's going to be on 8.5x11 paper, one or multiple pages, laying flat mostly. It's also going to be reproduced, 106 copies. So - whatever works in that capacity. 

If you want to write - cool! If want to make an image with your hands or a machine - very cool!  Circuit boards or organic materials - just remember, laying flat and reproducibility. Probably no knives, explosives, </font>liquids more than 3 oz, &c. - <font color = "white">but I'm open to discussing how to make </font>things work. 

###### _What up with Detroit Art Book Fair?_

<font color = "white">It's hosted </font>by DittoDitto a<font color = "white">nd takes place </font>over a weekend at T<font color = "white">rinosophes Gal</font>lery adj<font color = "white">acent to Det</font>roit's Eastern M<font color = "white">arke</font>t.
